Sainsburys Calorie counter tool
-------------------------------

Basically webscrapper which creates a pie chart representing the calorie distribution of items in a Sainsburys recept pdf.

Dockerized application which adds Selenium standalone for navigating the Sainsburys UK website to get calorie information of each item in the reciept.


TBD

Improve speed through use of parellelization. Currently delays have been added between steps to avoid identification of selenium by the website.
This slows down the execution.
